# React + Vite App

This is a UI-based application built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It includes a sign-in page and a repositories dashboard. The app utilizes `react-router-dom` for routing between pages.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides an optimized development environment for React.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- **react-router-dom**: A routing library for navigating between pages in a React application.

## Features

- **Sign In**: A simple authentication screen where users can log in.
- **Repositories Dashboard**: Displays a list of repositories with details like name, access level, languages, and updates.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the app locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have `Node.js` installed. If not, download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite specifies).

### 4. Build for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the production-ready files in the `dist/` folder.

### 5. Preview the Production Build

If you want to preview the production build locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server for previewing the production build.
